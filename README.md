# WindowsPhone-Oldies

Windows phone projects I wrote when Windows 8 was released. I upgraded them to Windows Phone 10 and then abandonned it when Windows Phone was abandonned in favor of UWP.

## Projects

| Name | Description | Capture |
| ---  | ---         | ---     |
| bN.CutCake | An augmented reality application to help slice pizzas, cakes, etc. Select number of slices, superpose your phone over the pizza and cut it. The app uses the phone camera and inclinometer to incline the image depending on phone orientation. | ![cut cake capture](https://github.com/bNobo/WindowsPhone-Oldies/blob/main/bN.CutCake/Design/wp_ss_20160228_0002.png) |
